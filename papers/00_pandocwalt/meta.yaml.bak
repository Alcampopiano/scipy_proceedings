abstract: "A short version of the long version that is way too long to be written as a
   short version anyway.  Still, when considering the facts from first
   principles, we find that the outcomes of this introspective approach is
   compatible with the guidelines previously established.

   In such an experiment it is then clear that the potential for further
   development not only depends on previous relationships found but also on
   connections made during exploitation of this novel new experimental
   protocol."
