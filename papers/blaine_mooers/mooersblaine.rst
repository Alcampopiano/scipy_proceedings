Modernizing computing by structural biologists with Jupyter and Colab
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

Protein crystallography produces most of the molecular structures used in structure-based drug design. 
The process of structure determination is computationally intensive and error-prone because many software packages are involved.
Here, we attempt to support the reproducibility of this computational work by using Jupyter Notebooks in JupyterLab or Google Colab. 
We have made libraries of code templates to ease running the crystallography packages in Jupyter Notebooks.
Our combined use of GitHub, snippet libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, and Colab will help modernize the computing done by structural biologists.

Introduction
------------

Structural biologists study the molecular structures of proteins and nucleic acids to understand how they function in biology and medicine. 
The underlying premise of the field is that molecular function follows molecular form.
More precise aliases for these scientists include molecular structural biologists, structural biochemists, and molecular biophysicists. 
Some of the methods used to determine the near-atomic resolution molecular structures include molecular modeling, X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-EM.
These scientists often use the molecular structures of these large biomolecules to design small-molecule drugs for improved therapies. 
As a result, structural biology plays a vital role in drug discovery and development, and many structural biologists work in the pharmaceutical industry.
Those in academia in the United States have their work funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Energy.

Structural biology is at the intersection of biochemistry, molecular biology, molecular biophysics, and computer science. 
Structural biologists have diverse backgrounds and varying levels of experience with computer programming ranging from essentially none to very advanced. 
Several decades ago, the barriers to entry into the field included expertise with running command-line-driven programs and the ability to write programs to meet unmet needs not met by existing software packages. 
However, these barriers have been lowered over the past two decades by the widespread availability of GUI-driven software that is often free for academics (e.g., CCP4 [Winn11]_, Phenix [Lieb11]_, CNS [Brun98]_, ATSAS [Mana21]_, BioXTAS [Hopk17]_, CCPEM [Burn17]_ ). 
As a result, biologists have become the largest component of the field.

Computing is involved in the six or more steps from structural data acquisition to publication.
Several alternate software packages are often available for each step. 
Different combinations of these alternatives lead to a combinatorial explosion of possible workflows. 
Although in some special situations, workers have set up software pipelines for some but not all of the steps.
However, these pipelines are difficult to transfer or have trouble with the challenging samples that cannot yet be handled without human intervention.
The current situation makes the computational work vulnerable to errors in tracking input and output files. 
Storing the code and outputs in Jupyter Notebooks would reduce this vulnerability . 

To ease crystal structure determination in Jupyter, we made libraries of code templates for crucial programs [Kluy16]_. 
We formatted the libraries for two code snippet extensions for JupyterLab. 
One extension (jupyterlab-snippets) provides access to snippets organized into nested pull-down menus. 
The other extension (elyra-code-snippet-extension) uses a search box to locate the desired snippet. 
The user can easily add new code snippets to both systems. 

We also ported the libraries to Google Colab.
Colab is an integrated development environment (IDE) for running Jupyter Notebooks on the Google Cloud Platform.
Colab spares the user of hardware maintenance and provides access to GPUs and TPUs. 
Colab also eases collaborative work and provides a uniform computing environment for classes and workshops.
The user can upload Jupyter Notebooks and data files to their Google Drive account and then run the notebooks in Colab.

Here, we have combined GitHub, domain-specific code snippet libraries, Jupyter notebooks, and Google Colab to support computing in biomolecular structure determination.
We think this approach will advance the field by improving productivity and reproducibility.
Our approach may inspire similar efforts to modernize other scientific fields endowed with legacy software.

*The remainder is mostly filler to be replaced with the draft text soon.*

Methods
-------

We created snippet libraries for each structural biology package to support structural biology computations in Jupyter and Colab.
Any particular workflow is unlikely to require all of the libraries.
For example, a beginnerâ€™s workflow is unlikely to use CCTBX, a library of Python wrapped C++ routines for building molecular structure determination software.
Likewise, a cryo-electron microscopy workflow will not need XDS, a package for processing X-ray diffraction images.
We created a GitHub site for each library to ease the downloading of only those libraries that interest users (Table :ref:`libraries`).
This modularization of the project should ease the correction and augmentation of individual libraries as the extensions, and structural biology software packages evolve.
We only provided libraries for JupyterLab because the Jupyter Project plans to phase out support for the Jupyter Notebook software.
Among the several alternative extensions for code snippets in JupyterLab, we choose jupyterlab-snippets [jLsnip]_ and Elyra [Elyra]_ because these two extensions are actively maintained and have different features.
We also support a snippet library for Juptyer notebooks on Google Colab as described below because Colab provides access to GPUs, which can accelerate some of the larger computational tasks.


jupyterlab-snippets externsion
******************************

The jupyterlab-snippets extension adds a snippet menu to the JupyterLab menu bar.
The user accesses the snippets through a cascading pulldown menu.
Each snippet resides in a separate plain text file.
The snippets are written in plain text files without any formatting.
This feature dramatically eases adding new snippets by users and eases keeping the snippets under version control.
The snippets are stored in the Jupyter data directory (which is found by entering :code:`jupyter --path`; it is in ~/Library/Jupyter/snippets).
Each snippet library is stored in a separate subfolder, which appears on the menu bar as a part of a cascading pulldown menu (Figure). 
We clustered snippets into categories. 
Each category has a cascading submenu.
Clicking on a snippet name in the submenu triggers its insertion into the current cell in the notebook.
The nested menu hierarchy serves well the user who is familiar with the content of the snippet libraries.

elyra-code-snippet extension
****************************

A menu icon labeled with `</>` provides access to snippets in the elyra-code-snippet-extension system.
After the icon is clicked, the snippets appear in the left margin of the JupyterLab GUI.
Snippets from all libraries appear in alphabetical order. 
The user can scroll through the list of snippets.
Hovering the mouse cursor over the snippet's name triggers the display of a description of the snippet.

Alternatively, the user can enter a search term in the search box at the top of the menu to reduce the list of snippets.
The search terms can be part of a snippet name or a tag stored with each snippet.

A tag icon displays all of the available tags in the snippets as separate icons.
The user can select tags to be used to choose snippets by clicking on the icons.

Each snippet is displayed with several icons (Figure).
A triangular toggle can trigger the display of the snippet in a textbox.
A pencil icon enables the editing of the code.
Other icons enable copying the code to the clipboard, inserting code into the current cell in the notebook, and deleting the snippet. 

A plus sign in the upper-righthand corner opens a GUI for the creation of a new snippet.
The GUI occupies the window that usually displays the notebook.
The GUI has a text box for each kind of metadata: name, description, tags, language, and the snippet code.

Each snippet is stored in a separate JSON file.
Each JSON file has the snippet code plus several rows of metadata, including a list of tags and the programming language of the snippet.
The latter provides a sanity check.
For example, an attempt to insert a C++ snippet into a notebook with an active Python kernel will trigger the opening of a window with a warning.
The directory ~/Library/Jupyter/metadata/code-snippets stores the snippet files on the Mac.
The tag system serves the user who is not familiar with the content of the installed libraries.


Colab snippet library
***********************

The Colab snippet system resembles the Elyra snippet system in that search terms in a search box retrieve snippets.
However, the Colab system differs from the Elyra system ins that a single notebook stores all of the snippets. The user's Google Cloud account stores the notebook of snippets.
The use of Colab requires that the user has a Google account and a Google Drive.
Many structural biologists already have both.

Notebooks on Colab open lighting fast, but the user must reinstall their software on each login.
We ease this annoying task by supplying the complete chain of installation steps.
For example, the installation of the molecular graphics program PyMOL requires seven code blocks of different types.
Some involve the use of curl, and others use conda.
We include all steps in one snippet, which is uniquely possible with the snippet system for Colab. 
The user only has to select one snippet and then run each code block in succession.


Availability of the snippet libraries
*************************************

We have shared these libraries on GitHub  (e.g., Table (:ref:`libraries`)).
Each library is also archived in zenodo.

The 





Structure determination and refinement workflows with Phenix
************************************************************

The Phenix software is an advanced and sophisticated software project that was initially developed for the refinement of protein crystal structures determined from X-ray diffraction data.
It has been under development for two decades by a team of professional software developers based at the Berkeley-Lawrence National Laboratory under the leadership of Paul Adams.
The project also includes several collaborators located around the world who develop auxiliary components of the package.

Paul Adams had spent the prior decade developing the XPLOR and then  the CNS packages at Yale University with Axel Brunger.
Shortly after arriving in the Bay Area, he was influenced by Warren Delano (the developer of the PyMOL molecular graphics program which is written in C but wrapped with Python) to also use Python to wrap CCTBX, the Computational Crystallography Tool Box, while developing Phenix.
CCTBX was originally written in Cpp but its components have been migrating to Python.
While Python eases the use of CCTBX, the harnessing of CCTBX requires at least intermediate if not advanced Python programming skills.
On the other hand, Phenix was designed to be user-friendly via initially command line usage and then via a user-friendly GUI.

The Phenix project is popular because it greatly eased the incorporation of simulated annealing into crystal structure refinement by hiding from the user the tedious preparation of parameter files that previously had to be customized for each structure.
These parameter files were required by the molecular dynamics software that carried out the simulated annealing.
The preparation and debugging of the parameter files could take many hours.

Simulated annealing involves doing molecular dynamics at high temperature to move parts of a molecular model out of local energy minima and into to conformations that fit the experimental data better.
Twenty minutes of the application of simulated annealing to an early model that still has numerous errors can lead to significant improvement in the model while saving the user a day or more of tedious manual rebuilding of the molecular model. 

The Phenix project is based on Python but the computationally intensive components are run in Cpp via the CCTBX package.
Users can interact with Phenix via a GUI interface, the command line, the command line plus the Phil domain-specific language scripts, the Python interpreter, or some combination thereof.
More recently, Phenix has been extended for refinement of crystal structures with neutron diffraction data and for structure determination and refinement with cryo electron microscopy data.
 
The Phenix software runs on top of CCTBX and provides higher-level user access via a command-line scripting language, a Python API, and a GUI.
The phenix.python interpreter still uses Python2 whereas CCTBX moved to Python3 several years ago.
On the other hand, Jupyter Lab and its extensions are best run with Python3.
The easiest workaround is to run Phenix by using the command line instead of Python.
The commands prepended with the exclamation mark to invoke the shell.
Of course, the equivalent CCTBX code for the phenix code could be run instead but this code can be many lines in length and it can be challenging for beginners to customize to a specific problem.
The most efficient approach can be to use the phenix command line as much as possible and then resort to CCTBX when the need arises.

For example, the command below invokes a statistical analysis of the B-factors in a pdb file, a common text file file format for storing atomic coordinates. 
The pdb file has a fixed format that was defined and popularized by the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the central public repository for atomic coordinates and structural data. 
The PDB is celebrating its 50 anniversary this year. 
It has and continues to play an central role in promoting the principles of open science and reproducible research in structural biology.

There are several dozen commands that can be run via the shell and return useful output that can be captured in one Jupyter Notebook rather than in dozens of log files.
The output can be copied and pasted into a new cell and then reformatted in markdown as a table or the copied output be used as input data to make a plot with matplotlib.
While these are basic data science tasks, they are intimidating to new users of Jupyter and some of the details are easy for more experienced users to forget.
To overcome this problem, we supply snippets that demonstrate how to transform the output and that can be used as templates by the users.  

These commands are becoming harder to find as the on-line documentation has been migrating to serving only the GUI interface.
The bash script files that run the phenix commands can be found by running 

.. code-block:: bash

    !ls /Applications/phenix-*/build/bin/phenix.\*

These shell scripts invoke Python scripts that capture the command line arguments and pass them to the phenix Python interpreter.


.. code-block:: bash

    ls /Applications/phenix-1.19.2-4158/modules/phenix/phenix/command_line/*.py.
